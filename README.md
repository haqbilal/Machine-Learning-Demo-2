# Machine-Learning-Demo-2

This demo contains examples on Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo in the TrueSkill model. We implement the TrueSkill model, examine the posterior for two players on toy data, and conduct Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo on two players with toy data. We then perform approximate inference conditioned on real data.
